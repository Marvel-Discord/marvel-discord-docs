The management team comprises of the @&[Celestial (Manager)](0) role. 

### Celestials (Managers)

Currently, there is only one management role, which encompasses all management responsibilities.

The current Celestial team consists of @[rocked03](204778476102877187), @[gryphyn](425133411837935628), @[julianinvictus](621018366655725570), @[neverrmett](734640971232444486), @[reignthunder](217157630215323648), @[rixov](1289511684058120193), @[shake.png](1034384071415050300), and @[sick_ranchez](947853707331121282).

#### MPermissions

As a security precaution, the Celestial role does not have any server management permissions. Users with this role, however, are able to temporarily grant themselves permissions with the command below. This gives necessary permissions to make changes to the server. The role is automatically removed after 24 hours or until the command is triggered again. 

```
/manage-server-perms
```

Additionally, Celestials are able to use the command below to access full moderation permissions. This is for moderation emergencies only, there is no obligation nor expectation to act as a regular moderator. Moderation decisions should still be deferred to a regular moderator if one is available; these permissions should only be required for worst-case scenarios when immediate action is required and no other moderators are available.

```
/moderation-perms
```
