# Event Listings

Not to be confused with activities run by the server, these Events are listings using Discord's built-in feature.

These events are typically one of three types: a movie/show release, a significant presentation, or a server event.

## Upcoming Releases

We use these listings to indicate release dates of upcoming Marvel projects, most frequently movies and TV shows.

When listing the time, if there is a universal release time (such as streaming projects), use that. Otherwise, use the date of the release in the US. When adding the location, label "Theatres", "Disney+", etc.

The description shouldn't be too difficult, but it's good to get in the best details. Rocked's preferred format is:

> ```
> *Promotional tag line*
>
> Starring **Main Star**, secondary star, list of the rest of the billed cast. Directed by **Director**.
>
> The film's official promotional synopsis here.
>
> Trailer: https://youtu.be/.... link if it exists yet.
> ```

Shows with weekly releases can also enable weekly recurrence. 

## Conventions & Presentations

Convention and presentation listings are typically for significant events, such as San Diego Comic-Con, New York Comic-Con, and Disney's Investor Day. Typically these are when major announcements are often made.

The event listing should list the exact time of the presentation if possible, otherwise a general time-frame (typically the convention duration) is fine. 

These events don't need detailed descriptions, just a brief overview of what the event is about. We don't often know what will be announced, so it's best to clearly outline the speculative parts ("may include" "might possibly cover" "historically/traditionally... "). 

## Server Events

There's no set standard for these, it's just nice to have a visible record for people to know when things are! Try and keep them visually tidy though.
