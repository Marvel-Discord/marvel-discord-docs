See [Rules](../../../moderation/rules.md).

## #[announcements](1110214786223968346)

This channel is for server-related announcements. It's rather loose on what belongs here, but it's typically used to announce updates (like spoiler channel changes), events, milestones, etc.

There's no guidelines on how formal or casual this channel should be, but messages should have some purpose (please don't use the channel to just shitpost!)

### How to post news

Send the link in the channel, easy as that. Jocasta auto-publishes it and [pings the @News Ping role](../roles/ping-roles#news-ping). If you want to send a message without a ping, just prepend the message with `@silent` then a newline.

```
@silent
News message here
```
