# Shareable Channels

These channels let members share their creativity, interests, and content. While they’re fun and open, they still need light moderation to avoid spam, off-topic posts, or rule-breaking content.

	•	No **AI-generated art** unless clearly tagged
	•	**No stolen or traced content**

## #[music](1110797967629242428)
