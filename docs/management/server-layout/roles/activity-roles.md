# Activity Roles

## Level Roles

Level roles are managed by the MEE6 bot, which tracks the message activity of users in the server. When a user sends a message (once per minute), they accumulate exp that contributes to their level. The levels are as follows:

- *@SHIELD Recruit* - Allows you to connect, but not speak in the voice channels (level 1).
- *@Inhuman* - Allows you to change your nickname and post images (level 3)
- *@New Mutant* - Allows you to speak in the voice channels, embed links and add reactions (level 10)
- *@Young Avenger* - (level 15)
- *@Future Foundation* - (level 20)
- *@Champion* - (level 25)
- *@Runaway* - (level 30)
- *@Thunderbolt* - Allows you to use TTS messages. (level 35)
- *@Nova Corps* - (level 40)
- *@HYDRA Agent* - (level 45)
- *@Defender* - (level 50)
- *@Web Warrior* - (level 60)
