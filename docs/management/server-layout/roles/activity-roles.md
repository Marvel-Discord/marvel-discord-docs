# Activity Roles

## Level Roles

Level roles are managed by the MEE6 bot, which tracks the message activity of users in the server. When a user sends a message (once per minute), they accumulate exp that contributes to their level. The levels are as follows:

- Level 1 - *@SHIELD Recruit* - Can use external emoji.
- Level 3 - *@Inhuman* - Can change nickname, send files and images, and add reactions
- Level 10 - *@New Mutant* - Allows you to speak in the voice channels and embed links.
- Level 15 - *@Young Avenger*
- Level 20 - *@Future Foundation*
- Level 25 - *@Champion*
- Level 30 - *@Runaway*
- Level 35 - *@Thunderbolt*
- Level 40 - *@Nova Corps*
- Level 45 - *@HYDRA Agent*
- Level 50 - *@Defender*
- Level 60 - *@Web Warrior*
- Level 70 - *@Eternal*
- Level 80 - *@Dark Avenger*
- Level 90 - *@H.A.M.M.E.R.*
- Level 100 - *@Assembled Avenger*
