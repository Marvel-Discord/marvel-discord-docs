## Head Staff

The head staff are the highest-ranking staff members on the server. They are responsible for overseeing the server and making sure everything runs smoothly. They have the final say in all decisions and are responsible for making sure the server is a safe and welcoming place for everyone.

There are head staff for each of the management and moderation teams.

## Management Team

See [Management Overview](../../#staff-structure) for more information.

Applications for the management team are currently closed.

## Moderation Team

See [Moderation Overview](../../../moderation/#staff-structure) for more information.

Applications for the moderation team are currently closed. Applications for casual moderation roles are opened periodically.

## Retired Staff

Retired staff are former staff members who have stepped down from their roles and are still in the server.

## Staff Friends

Staff friends are incredibly special cases where we need to give a non-staff member access to staff channels. This is determined by the head staff.
