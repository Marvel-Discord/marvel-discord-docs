## Server Info

The [#resource-server-info](https://discord.com/channels/281648235557421056/1109722494002286642) page in the Marvel Discord server guide is typically used to display the shortest and sweetest (i.e. concise) amount of info we have about the Marvel Discord server. If you had twenty words or less to describe the Marvel Discord, this is where it would go. Only keeping the most, absolute critical information for our users. It is really important not to overload them with information about server structure, because they will not retain it all. Short and sweet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

The [#resource-faq](https://discord.com/channels/281648235557421056/1109722813058777148) page in the server guide is used to display frequently-asked-questions. We will *never* be able to anticipate every question a new user (or a returning user) may have, but we can try to note what the most frequently asked ones are! If you see an issue/point of confusion popping up frequently in chat (or Modmail) please let someone on the Management team know, and we can adjust the FAQ to reflect it! 

## Contact Staff

Similarly to [#resource-server-info](https://discord.com/channels/281648235557421056/1109722494002286642), the [#resource-contact-staff](https://discord.com/channels/281648235557421056/1109723001836011621) page should be as short as possible. We want to direct users to Modmail **as much as humanly possible**. This has likely been stressed in other areas of this resource guide/website, but we want to encourage users to contact staff through Modmail all the time--going through DMs is not an option.

## Ban Appeals

Another short one, [#resource-ban-appeals](https://discord.com/channels/281648235557421056/1109723183612964864) is only there to direct users (typically friends of banned users) on how they can appeal a ban: Modmail.

## Activities & Events

The [#resource-activities](https://discord.com/channels/281648235557421056/1109723474177560647) page should be regularly updated to reflect the types/categories of events hosted in the Marvel Discord. Some past examples have been Book Club (for comics), Polls, and one-off events like movie nights. 

## Spoiler Channel Archive Map

The [#resource-spoiler-archive](https://discord.com/channels/281648235557421056/1109723343814406224) channel is a lovely resource that aggregates all of the past spoiler channels into one neat resource. The way the spoiler links work, is that we have 2-3 rotating channels that change topic everytime a new spoiler topic is declared. For example, `channel 1` may be home to the Fantastic 4: First Steps spoilers from June 2025-August 2025, but after August, it will be converted to a new movie. The channel itself will not be deleted or purged, but instead a new topic will be declared, and a link will be grabbed to the Fantastic 4 discussion to be posted in [#resource-spoiler-archive](https://discord.com/channels/281648235557421056/1109723343814406224). This channel is inarguably the most fluid, as the spoiler channels change over as often as new Marvel projects are published.
