# Website

We have a website! It can be found at https://marvelcord.com/.

This website is [open-source](https://github.com/Rocked03/marvel-discord-site), built using Next.js and Typescript, and is hosted using Netlify. 

## Invite

The https://marvelcord.com/invite page is an automatic redirect to our server invite link (https://discord.gg/marvel).

## Appeal

The https://marvelcord.com/appeal page details everything needed for appealing a ban. It includes a link to the Post Office server and the required details to include in the appeal.

If somebody asks about appealing a ban, please direct them to this page!
