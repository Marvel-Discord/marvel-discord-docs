# __Content Rules__
## 1. We prohibit:
### 1. NSFW, Piracy, & Other Illegal Content
* This is a PG-13 server, therefore NSFW is strictly prohibited, as is discussion surrounding NSFW topics. This includes gore, porn, etc., and content considered “borderline” may still result in action. If you are unsure, please ask a mod.
* We do not condone piracy. You are not allowed to share or explain means of pirating content, nor request it. This includes sharing files, links, or streams to pirated comics, movies, and shows, as well as illegally-recorded ‘cam footage’.
 * You may suggest a movie to stream, and we can try organising a legal event. 
### 2. Spam
* Sending large, frequent, repetitive, and/or unwanted messages is considered spam and not allowed. This also includes memes, copypastas, mentioning large numbers of users, etc. Please do not also spam as an attempt to level up quicker, as that is set to one message per minute. 
### 3. Political Topics
* Strong discussion about politics is not allowed. We are a server centred around the Marvel franchise, so political discussion that is directly related to Marvel is allowed in moderation and with respect for others.
* However, we allow discussion about religion and LGBTQ+ and expect respect towards all races, genders, religions, cultures, etc. Everyone has their own beliefs - do not be dismissive or discriminatory against a certain community or minority.
### 4. Language
* We do not allow *any* slurs in this server. Profanity is allowed, as long as it is not used excessively or to insult anybody. Please keep in mind that this is a PG-13 server.
* As we are an English-speaking server and can only provide Moderation support in English, we do not allow discussion in foreign languages.

### 5. Advertisements
* Advertising is not allowed. This includes:
 * Server invites
 * Self-promotion of other Social Media, such as YouTube, Instagram, etc. (this is allowed in a limited quantity in #[share-fan-creations](1110201220666228858))
* If you feel like you have a valid reason and would like to request an exception, please contact Modmail.
### 6. Roleplay
* Roleplay is disruptive to conversation, therefore not allowed. Please do not invoke nor incite roleplay.
* Impersonation of people (real & fictional), characters, users, etc is prohibited.

---

## 2. Use appropriate channels
* We provide numerous channels for various topics. Please stick to these topics when you are chatting in these channels, and move to a more appropriate channel if you do not.
### 1. Spoiler Rules
We provide numerous spaces to discuss spoilers for recent content. We expect all users to respect and follow these rules.
* **Marvel Content**
 * **Unreleased** content: Leaks, rumours, non-primary promotion, etc. belong in #[comic-spoilers](1109731683177078867) | #[future-screen-spoilers](1109731729385721926)
 * **New Comics**: Comics that are less than __1 week old__ belong in #[comic-spoilers](1109731683177078867).
 * **Films and Shows**: Recently-released films and shows will have their own dedicated spoiler channel. Spoilers must be kept in this channel and #[future-screen-spoilers](1109731729385721926) until the dedicated channel has been closed. 
* **Non-Marvel Content**
 * For non-Marvel films, shows, and games that are less than __1 month old__, please use the appropriate thread in #[non-marvel-spoilers](1109733536832946196). If a thread does not exist, please request it!

# __Behaviour Rules__
## 3. We expect:
### 1. No drama
* This is not a place for drama. If you have an issue with another user, please take it elsewhere or discuss it with staff via Modmail.
* We ask that you do not bring your drama from elsewhere into our server.
### 2. No harassment
* Please do not harass other users. If you have an issue or are being harassed, please discuss this with staff via Modmail.
### 3. Respectfulness
* Be respectful of everybody, even if they do not share the same opinion as you.
* This applies both to people within the server, and also when discussing other people outside of the server.

## 4. Don’t be a rules lawyer
* These rules are an **outline** of what we expect in our server. This server’s moderators reserve the right to make decisions based on their own judgement, even if something is not explicitly in breach of these rules.
* We ask that you do not “minimod” - moderators enforce the rules such that you do not need to yourself. 
* Please follow these rules as they exist for the benefit of the health and wellbeing of the community.
## 5. Follow Discord’s ToS & Guidelines
* As a public community on Discord, our rules are a superset of Discord’s own Terms of Service and Guidelines, which we also enforce.
 * Terms of Service - !https://dis.gd/tos
 * Community Guidelines - !https://dis.gd/guidelines
