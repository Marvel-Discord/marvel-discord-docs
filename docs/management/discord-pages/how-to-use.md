# Discord Pages

These pages that can be written within the docs and then synced to the server via the Jocasta bot. These are made for "static" channels, where content is not expected to change often, such as #rules and Server Guide channels.

## How to Use

The entire content of these pages will be used as the content of the channel. This means that you can use all the same formatting as you would in a normal message, including images, links, and embeds.
