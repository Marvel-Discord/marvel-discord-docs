# Affiliations

We occasionally affiliate with other servers we think are cool! These servers get listed in #[server-affiliates](1109728410894356500).

## Requirements

We have two criteria for affiliation:
1. Must be reasonably active and established, and
2. Must be somewhat related to the topic of our own server.

An additional, unspoken criteria is that the server must be of a high quality, as well as being standout in some manner. This could be from being unique, doing something cool, being a leading community in their area, etc.

We're looking to build a network of servers that we think our community would enjoy. We're not interested in affiliating with servers who reach out with the intent to *grow* their community via ours. 

## Process

Users must DM Modmail with the details of the server they are representing. We have an `!!!affiliation` snippet that prompts users to provide the necessary info - server name, invite, and a brief description.

A Manager checks out the server and decides whether or not to affiliate with it. We have a `!!!declineaf` snippet for declinations, but accepted affiliations require more communication. 

:::tip

For info on how to use Modmail, see the [Modmail](../moderation/modmail/usage.md) page.

:::

Successful affiliate representatives get the @[Server Partner](0) role. This gives them permissions to post their own server information in #[server-affiliates](1109728410894356500).

Conversely, we provide our own server information to the affiliates for them to post into their own server. Sometimes, this advert is posted by us rather than them.
