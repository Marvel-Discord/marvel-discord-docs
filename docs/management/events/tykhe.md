# TYKHE

TYKHE is a Discord-based digital card-collecting gacha game. It's a joint venture by the Marvel Studios and DC Films servers, and we're a partner server in this activity.

We don't do anything in particular to help run the activity.

:::info[Bridge Server]

They have a "Bridge of Unity" hub server. The custom invite is https://discord.gg/tykhe, but sometimes it's unavailable so https://discord.gg/tykhe-bridge-of-unity-793671273485303858 works as well.

All details about TYKHE can be found in this server.
