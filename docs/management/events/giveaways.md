Occasionally we will host giveaways in the server. These normally correlate with significant events (e.g., anniversaries, server milestones, etc.) or as prizes for activities and events. Occasionally, we may also host giveaways if a user is willing to donate a prize.

## Sponsorship

Giveaways need somebody to sponsor the prize. Common prizes include Discord Nitro, avatar decorations, as well as Steam game codes, unwanted game/application keys, etc.

When accepting a sponsorship, please check these details:

- The prize is appropriate for the server and not against Discord's TOS. No distribution of NSFW, illegal goods, etc.
- The prize is not a scam. If the prize is a game key, check that it is not a stolen key. If the prize is something like Discord Nitro, ensure that the user is willing to pay for it and won't back out.
- The prize is available internationally. Many codes are region-locked, so this needs to be checked before accepting the sponsorship. If the prize is not available in most regions, then a decision needs to be made for whether it is suitable to give away. If a region-locked prize is offered, then the giveaway should clearly state the eligibility.

## Hosting

Giveaways are typically hosted in three manners: automated raffle, manual raffle, and as a prize.

Giveaway announcements should always clearly state the prize on offer, how to enter, the duration of the giveaway, and any eligibility requirements.

### Automated Raffle

Automated raffles are hosted via the [Giveaway Bot](../bots/giveaway-bot). These are best suited when everybody can enter as the bot automatically and randomly selects a winner.

### Manual Raffle

Manual raffles are more suited for smaller giveaways or when entries need to pass a manually-checked eligibility requirement. There's no strict way to host these, but sites like [Wheel of Names](https://wheelofnames.com/) are great for this.

### Prize

Prizes can be offered to participants of events or activities. Ensure that the prize offered is clearly stated at the beginning of the event or activity, and that it is clearly stated what is required to win the prize (e.g., most voted, top points, etc.).

## Distribution

Prizes need to be kept secure and should always be tracked by a manager. This ensures that the staff team is always responsible and accountable for the prize and that it is fulfilled successfully. Even if the prize is sponsored by a user not on the staff team, it should still be held and distributed by a manager.

Prizes should be distributed via Modmail for full accountability. These should be distributed as soon as possible after the giveaway ends. Exceptions may include Discord shop items that require being gifted directly to a friend.
