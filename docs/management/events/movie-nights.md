# Movie Nights

We occasionally and irregularly host movie nights. We don't have any strict reasons why and when we do, but if anybody is keen to host one, there rarely is any reason not to!

## A few tips

Here's just a few things to take into consideration when hosting a movie night:

### Timezones

There's a lot of people from many different parts of the world. Our largest demographics are in America, Europe, and Asia, so you'll get the most engagement if you cater towards these timezones. Most users are studying or working, so they have their mornings, days, and mid-afternoons on weekdays unavailable.

### Hosting

**It is illegal and against the [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms#7) to stream copyrighted content.** This means you cannot stream copyrighted movies or shows via screen-sharing in voice chat. This applies to any form of streaming the media, including streaming platforms, home media (DVDs, etc.), piracy, etc.

This is certainly the biggest hindrance to hosting movies nights. However, there are a few ways to get around this:
- [Teleparty](https://www.teleparty.com/) - This is a Chrome extension that allows you to sync up Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video.
- [Scener](https://scener.com/) - This is a Chrome extension that allows you to sync up Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video.
- [Kast](https://kast.gg/) - This is a desktop app that allows you to sync up Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video.
These are allowed, as they are not streaming the content, but rather syncing it up with other users.

Importantly, every user must be able to supply their own stream of the content. Copyright law prohibits sharing content, so the solution is for each person to provide their own stream.
