# Game Nights

We occasionally host game nights. This is a very broad category for any game night hosted in the server. 

## A few tips

### Timezones

There's a lot of people from many different parts of the world. Our largest demographics are in America, Europe, and Asia, so you'll get the most engagement if you cater towards these timezones. Most users are studying or working, so they have their mornings, days, and mid-afternoons on weekdays unavailable.

### Hosting

Different games have different interactions. Some games are more suited for larger groups, while others are better for smaller groups. Try and plan towards a certain group size beforehand so you can pick out a game that suits. For inclusivity, try to support larger groups, as this allows more people to join in - although be prepared to pivot if the group ends up being smaller. 

### Games

Party games are always great! Even better if they're free and accessible. Here's a few popular ones:

- [Scribbl](https://skribbl.io/) - A drawing game where you draw a word and others have to guess it. Can support up to 50 players.
- [Jackbox](https://jackboxgames.com/) - A series of party games that are great for larger groups. The host needs to own the game, but others can join in via their phones. Can support groups upwards of 8 players (depending on the game) + more spots for audience.
- [Among Us](https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/) - A social deduction game where players have to figure out who the imposter is. Can support up to 15 players.
- [Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com/) - A drawing game where players have to draw a word and others have to guess it. Can support up to 16 players.
- [Marvel Rivals](https://marvelrivals.com/) - A Marvel-branded third-person shooter game.
