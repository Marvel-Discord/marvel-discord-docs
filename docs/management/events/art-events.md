Art events are long-running activities encouraging people to create art.

## Schedule

These events are typically hosted once or twice a year, often to corroborate with an event, holiday, or month. We've previously had events for "Drawtober", "Maysthetic", Valentine's, Deadpool & Wolverine, etc. The events run for a few weeks to a month, depending on the size.

## Prompts

Prompts are typically themed around the event's occasion, as well as being lightly Marvel-themed.

There are multiple ways to provide prompts

- Daily prompts - each day, a new prompt is released. Pros: Encourages daily engagement. Cons: Is often hard to keep up with, and can be overwhelming.
- Periodic prompts - prompts are released every few days. Pros: Easier to keep up with. Cons: Potentially less engagement with less art being created.
- Grouped prompts - prompts are released in groups, and users can pick and choose which ones they want to do. Pros: Gives more freedom to people. Cons: Less consistency across the event.

Make sure to prepare all the prompts prior to the event starting.

## Setting it up

We have existing #[art-event](1204608353859276871) forum channels that are made to be used for these events. This is what they need to be set up:

- Rename the channel to match the event, e.g. `#drawtober`, `#valentines-art-event`
- Create a new post tag with the event's name
  - Create additional `Prompt #x` tags if needed
- Create an introductory post
  - This provides any info required about the event, such as rules, details, FAQ, etc.
  - This is also where the prompts can be posted.
  - Pin this post.
- When ready, unlock the channel by enabling the `Create Posts` permission for the `@everyone`.

## Competition

Art events can be run as a competition if you choose! Doing so means that you'll need to introduce some way to rank the art, most commonly via voting through reactions.

If you're hosting a competition, keep these things in mind:

- A prize needs to be provided. Make sure this is organised and sponsored prior to the event starting and clearly announced upon the start of the event.
- Competition brings out a lot of competitive spirit, so be prepared. Make sure to have a clear set of rules and guidelines for the event, including how the voting will work, how the winner will be chosen, and what the prize will be.

## Roles

Participation roles are effectively a standard for our art events - everybody who takes part receives a cosmetic role! Make sure to create a new role, name it appropriately, and give it a neat colour. Don't forget to distribute them!

## Hosting

Hosting is just a matter of making sure you stay up to date with announcing the prompts and keeping everybody engaged! Make sure that everybody is following the rules. Remember to follow up with roles and prizes at the end of the event.
