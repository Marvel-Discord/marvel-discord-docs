# Polls

Polls are daily Marvel questions asked to the server. These are handled through the Jocasta bot.

## Categories

- MCU - Questions about the Marvel Cinematic Universe of movies and TV shows. Generally opinion- or experience-based questions.
- Comics - Questions about Marvel Comics. Occasionally an extra catch-all for games and animated shows, etc.
- Comics vs MCU Designs - Comparisons between the comic and adaptation designs of characters. Compares to not only the MCU, but other films, shows, and games as well.
- MCU Predictions - Predictions about upcoming MCU movies and shows. These are typically asked every two weeks and cannot be voted on after the poll closes. Prediction- rather than opinion-based questions.
- Topical - Questions about current movies, shows, etc. Each project has its own category tag. These are asked around the release date of the content.
