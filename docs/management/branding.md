# Server Branding

This server has a number of branding elements, centred around our own derivation of the Marvel branding. 

:::info[Fun fact]

The server's graphics are mostly all designed by Rocked03, using a mix of [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (SVG graphics), Photoshop, [Pixlr E](https://pixlr.com/editor/) (free online Photoshop substitute), and PowerPoint (previously covered Figma's role).

## Icon

Our primary icon is the classic Discord chat bubble icon with the M from the Marvel logo in the centre.

When using the icon, it should be positioned such that the square of the chat bubble is centred, with the stem at the bottom extending further.

## Logos

Our standard logo is our icon in white and black on a red background (same colour as the Marvel logo). Sometimes the background is a red-tinted comic collage (although this graphic requires updating, it's quite old).

![Main logo](<../../static/img/branding/Logo 2000x2000.svg>)

However, we have many logos that are thematically styled to match topical Marvel content, such as movies, shows, games, and comics. These all use this base logo as a starting point.

Importantly, the chat bubble shape should carry through into the final stylised design. It doesn't always have to be the exact same shape, sometimes it is edited/redesigned/reshaped to fit the overall image, but it typically is still recognisable as a square with a stem on the bottom right (connected by extending the right edge and creating a notch in the bottom edge).

It's also good if the "M" is also carried through into the final design, however, this is not quite as important and is sometimes substituted for another icon that matches the theme more significantly. Sometimes the typeface of this M changes to match as well.

See the archive of logos for examples of these.

## Banners

:::info
Check out all our banners at https://marvelcord.com/gallery/banner and the wallpapers at https://marvelcord.com/gallery/wallpaper.
:::

The server banner is the image that is displayed at the top of the channel list. We have a considerably less consistent design style for these, but we try to still maintain our server's branding within them.

The banner typically just needs to reflect the current theme, which is also typically in the logo (although sometimes if there are multiple things, the banner will have a different theme to the logo). Sometimes this is art/graphic made by us for the server and sometimes it's film/show/comic art.

Somewhere in the banner should be our server icon, and optionally the Marvel logo. 

### Wallpapers

A subset of our banners are wallpapers, which are high-resolution themed collages of Marvel stills and art. They all follow a general hexagonal template, although this is just an arbitrary standard and is open to change.

## Other elements

### Fonts

We don't have a specific font we use consistently. However, we do use a mix of these:
- The icon uses the M directly from the Marvel logo (this is not a standard font).
- Our website uses **[Mona Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mona+Sans)**.
- A lot of our more classic graphics use **Uni Sans Heavy**.
 
:::warning
Uni Sans Heavy is a paid font and not legally available for free. We've used it in the past but without a license - realistically we shouldn't continue to use it and instead migrate to something else (potentially more Mona Sans, in line with the website).
