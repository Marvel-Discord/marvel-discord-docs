# About Modmail

[Marvel Modmail](https://discord.com/users/915931490666283058) is a Discord bot that facilitates the sending of direct messages to the server's staff team.

Modmail allows us to provide a consistent approach to moderation cases. While individual moderator DMs can often result in inconsistent approaches, lost records, and miscommunication, Modmail opens a line between the user and the whole moderation team. This means that all moderators are able to be informed and involved in all moderation discussions with no potentially important information lost due to some chain of Chinese whispers screenshots. All communication, both internally and with users, is logged so that it can be referenced at any point..

All staff-side Modmail interactions are handled in the [Moderation Hub](https://discord.com/channels/915931105977319455/915931106426097716). This server is only accessible to full-time moderators and managers. Ping a head staff in the staff room if you're missing access.

This bot is a self-hosted fork of [Dragory's Modmail bot](https://github.com/Dragory/modmailbot).

## Guidelines

Please be polite and professional. Modmail is not a place to bring your own opinionated arguments, this serves more as a customer service-like line. Our job here is to communicate clear information and decisions.

Do not share anything from Modmail publicly, for obvious reasons. This includes sharing any Modmail log link (and also please don't send any log links in other threads either, so the links don't get recorded in the message logs).

## If Modmail is down:

Contact Rocked03.
