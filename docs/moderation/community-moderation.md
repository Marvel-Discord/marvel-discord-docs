# Community Moderation

The Moderation team is responsible for enforcing the rules and guidelines of the server. We want to try and have a consistent approach to moderation, which is outlined in this document.

## Appeals

Appeals **must** be submitted through Modmail by the user who was banned. Appeals submitted by a third party must be redirected using the `!!!middleman` snippet. Appeals cannot be submitted or processed through individual DMs. 

How to decide an appeal TODO

### How to process an appeal

1. Get the Modmail link with `!loglink`
2. Get their ID with `!id`
3. Unban them using the log link as the reason - `!unban [user id] [log link]`
4. Send an appeal acception message with `!!!acceptap` (do this last, so they're able to join immediately)
