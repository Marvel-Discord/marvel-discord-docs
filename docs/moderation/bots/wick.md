# Wick

Wick is our anti-nuke bot. 

This bot prevents anyone from doing any dangerous actions, such as deleting multiple channels, roles, etc. in a short period of time. If this happens, the user gets "quarantined". This strips them of all their roles and permissions until an admin "unquarantines" them. 

## Commands

### Quarantine

This is only accessible to admins. 

```
/quarantine add [user]
```

```
/quarantine remove [user]
```
