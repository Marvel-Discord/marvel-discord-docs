# F.R.I.D.A.Y.

F.R.I.D.A.Y. is our in-house backup bot.

All Carl-bot server logs are relayed through to a backup channel in the Moderation server. 

It's made in-house (by Rocked), so if there's any custom moderation actions that get automated, it'll be done by this bot. Otherwise, its job is just as an automated process running in the background.
