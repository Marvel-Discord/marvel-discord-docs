# Moderation Overview

This set of documentation covers fields that are covered by the Watcher (moderation) team.

These are the tasks required to keep the community and channels safe, healthy, and welcoming.

## Staff structure

The co-heads of the moderation team are Shake (@[shake.png](1034384071415050300)) and Finn (@[gryphyn](425133411837935628)).

The moderation team comprises of the @[Watcher (Moderation)](0) and @[Ultimate (Casual Mod)](0) roles.

### Watchers (Moderators)

Watchers are full-time moderators. They have the full responsibilities of a moderator with full moderation capabilities, including bans and appeals.

The current Watcher team consists of @[gryphyn](425133411837935628), @[shake.png](1034384071415050300), @[cs0119](582080465482285056), @[devil_jin_987](1107591484624093184), @[morganstarkk](1164870671302660222), @[sean](853459869218897970), and @[vokzul](162453378364997633).

### Ultimates (Casual Moderators)

Ultimates are casual-term moderators. They have partial responsibilities of a moderator, with the ability to warn and mute members, notably in cases where Watchers are unavailable.

Their position lasts a fixed-term of roughly one month. Each period, the number of casual mods required is decided internally and positions are filled from both casual mods interested in remaining and other users interested in joining, all at the discretion of the head mods.

### Moderators in Training

Newly inducted Watchers (full-time moderators) first start in training. After a set period of time, if they prove themselves to be a capable member of the team, they become a fully-fledged Watcher.
